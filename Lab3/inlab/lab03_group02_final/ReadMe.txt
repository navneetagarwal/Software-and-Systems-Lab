How to use?
 THe procedure is pretty standard and copy the extra files for Q3a and Q3b. The values changed are only the density of the open box in Question 3a and we required 0 small balls for tipping the ball off the plank.
For Q3b we have only changed the density and friction of the large box on the left hand side. 
For part challenge we have implemented it such that we can change the position of any object in the world and when we drop the object it will have a free fall from that position. Collision is detected for this object. We can drag ANY object anywhere in space.
