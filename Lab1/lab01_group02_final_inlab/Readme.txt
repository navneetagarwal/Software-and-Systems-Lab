How to run ProjectileMotion.m
0. Value of g, k, set_precision can be changed in the code on the line 10, 11, 12 respectively.
1. Input Initial, final coordinates as per the given question
2. Input the velocity 
3. Code has been well commented as to the function of each loop or condition 
4. Output will show all possible ranges of values for angles for time t > 0
5. No output implies that no value is possible for the given input.
6. Singleton Set implies the value is unique at the precision of 10^-3
7. A closed interval with same values as the limits imply that the value has been rounded off
8. The precision value has been reduced to reduce the time taken for the code to run. It can be changed from line 12
9. Demo Output
Initial x- Coordinate 0
Initial y- Coordinate 0
Final x- Coordinate 10
Final y- Coordinate 0
Velocity 10

Dart can hit for the angle {-81.60}
Dart can hit for the angle {-79.57}
Dart can hit for the angle {81.61}
Dart can hit for the angle {82.98}
Dart can hit for the angle {87.21}
