How to use:

1)Errors in Q1:

1. In Main.java, line 11 - printl was written instead of println.
2. In gcd.java, in myGcd public class, the recursive defination is wrong. It should be r = m % n.

2) For Q3, the client will first enter the IP address of the server. (We didn't ask the server for that, that was trivial). The server will be asked for acceptance. If he types 'Yes', then connection is established. (Can be modified to 'Sure!' as well). To end the chat, server can either refuse to talk to the client or typing anything after ending chat while not connected to client.

3) For Q4, the decryption algorithm is not working. The keys are being exchanged and messages are being received in encryoted form but decryption isn't wokring. We posted a doubt regarding it on piazza as well. Other than that most things have been covered.
