How to use?
Python gives Output.txt
We have preserved the spaces in the output and we have also removed the '/*' and '//' symbols in the output.txt
In header 6 lines have been added and 1 removed
In Cpp files 7 lines added and 6 lines removed
Log is in log.txt in which we have added the message from git log

In comment_finder you have to give the cpp files name as the commandline argument
